### What I learned

This was a fun first lesson to work on. I tried to approach it in an industry-standard way by setting up a :root with variables for colors, typography, spacing, and border radius. Playing around with CSS custom properties gave me a better understanding of how design tokens can make styling cleaner and more consistent.

I also practiced translating the design from Figma into code, which helped me connect the visual specs (colors, spacing, typography, shadows) with their CSS counterparts. It felt great to see the design come to life in the browser while keeping the structure organized from the start.
